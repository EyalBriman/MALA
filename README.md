We introduce a multi-objective decision-making model for social choice that integrates time-based constraints, aiming to generate a ranked list that harmonizes both agent preferences (as, e.g., per approval ballots) together with overarching global constraints. First, we analyze the general model, showing that it is generally NP-hard, but admits polynomial-time algorithms for a special case; we also develop heuristic solutions for the general case. Furthermore, we explore potential applications of the model and demonstrate its relevance by focusing on the use cases of democratic playlist editing and democratic job scheduling. In these scenarios, our aim is to generate a list that reflects agent preferences for a given set of musical tracks or a given set of jobs to be processed while also considering soft constraints regarding the sequencing and transitions of tracks or jobs over time. We illustrate how these problems can be translated into our model, and present simulation results where we apply our heuristics to solve specific instances of the problems. We contend that our results are promising -- as they are able to strike a balance between the different optimization objectives -- not only for these specific use cases, but also for a plethora of other use cases that we introduce here.
